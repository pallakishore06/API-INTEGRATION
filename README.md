# 🌐 Dynamic API Data Display Webpage
# 📌 Project Overview
This project is a responsive webpage built using modern web technologies to dynamically fetch and display data from a public API. It demonstrates core principles of frontend development, API integration, and responsive design, making it ideal for developers interested in learning how real-time data can be used to create interactive web interfaces.
The goal is to provide users with up-to-date content such as weather reports, news updates, or other relevant data pulled from freely accessible APIs. The page adapts seamlessly across devices, ensuring optimal usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
# 🚀 Features
- Real-Time API Integration: Fetches live data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or NewsAPI).
- Responsive Design: Uses CSS media queries and flexbox/grid layout to adapt across screen sizes.
- Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Injects API content into the page without requiring manual refreshes.
- Loading/Error Handling: Displays feedback for loading states and handles API errors gracefully.
- Modular Code Structure: Organized and reusable code for easier maintenance and scalability.
# 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5: Semantic structure for content presentation
- CSS3: Styling and responsive design
- JavaScript (ES6+): Asynchronous API calls using fetch, dynamic content rendering
- Public API: (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or NewsAPI — configurable)

# 📖 How It Works
- Upon loading the webpage, JavaScript initiates a fetch call to the selected API.
- API responses are parsed and key data fields are extracted.
- The content is rendered dynamically into HTML elements using DOM manipulation.
- Responsive styles ensure the layout adjusts across device types.
# ✅ Setup Instructions
- Clone this repository:
